| `npm run optimize:memory` | Memory-focused optimization with GC |
| `npm run performance:analyze` | Analyze current performance metrics |
| `npm run performance:monitor` | Start performance monitoring |
| `npm run performance:report` | Generate performance report |

## 🏗️ Build Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build:tools` | Build TypeScript tools with optimization |
| `npm run build:optimized` | Incremental optimized build |
| `npm run build:production` | Full production build with optimization |

## 🖥️ Server Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|

## 📊 Monitoring & Reports

### Performance Reports
Generated automatically in:
- `optimization-report.json` - Autonomous optimization results
- `build-report.json` - Build process performance

### Health Check Endpoints
- `GET /` - API information and system status
- `GET /health` - Comprehensive health check (Fly.io compatible)
- `GET /api/status` - Detailed system status
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics

### Metrics Available
- **Memory Usage**: Heap utilization, RSS, external memory
- **Performance**: Request count, error rate, response times
- **Build Stats**: Compilation time, file counts, errors
- **System Info**: Node.js version, platform, uptime

## 🔧 Configuration

### TypeScript Configuration
Automatic `tsconfig.json` generation with optimized settings:
- ES2020 target for modern performance
- Incremental compilation
- Source maps and declarations
- Strict type checking

### Memory Optimization
Run with garbage collection enabled:
```bash
node --expose-gc server.js
```

### Environment Variables
```env
PORT=8080                    # Server port
NODE_ENV=production          # Environment mode
NODE_OPTIONS="--expose-gc"   # Enable garbage collection
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
1. **TypeScript compilation fails**: Fallback build system activates automatically
2. **Missing dist directory**: Created automatically during build
3. **Module resolution errors**: ES module exports added automatically

### Performance Issues
1. **High memory usage**: Run `npm run optimize:memory`
2. **Slow startup**: Use incremental builds with `npm run build:optimized`
3. **Request timeouts**: Check `/metrics` endpoint for bottlenecks

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Clean all caches and reports
npm run clean:all

# Validate system health
npm run validate:full

# Reset to clean state
npm run reset
```

## 📋 System Requirements

- **Node.js**: >= 18.0.0
- **npm**: >= 8.0.0
- **TypeScript**: ^5.7.2 (dev dependency)
- **Memory**: Minimum 512MB, Recommended 1GB+
