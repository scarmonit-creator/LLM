# GitHub Workflow Standardization Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the standardized performance optimization patterns implemented across all GitHub workflows in this repository. These standards ensure consistent performance, resource efficiency, and reliable execution across our CI/CD pipeline.

## ⚡ Core Optimization Principles

### 1. **Aggressive Concurrency Control**

All workflows MUST implement concurrency controls to prevent resource conflicts and queue buildup:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

**Exception**: Deployment workflows should use `cancel-in-progress: false` to ensure production deployments complete.

### 2. **Pre-flight Change Detection**

Implement intelligent execution by detecting relevant changes before running expensive operations:

```yaml
jobs:
  preflight:
    name: Pre-flight Change Detection
    outputs:
      should-run: ${{ steps.changes.outputs.should-run }}
    steps:
      - name: Analyze changes
        id: changes
        run: |
          if git diff HEAD~1 --name-only | grep -E 'relevant-pattern'; then
            echo "should-run=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "should-run=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi
```

### 3. **Enhanced Path Filtering**

Use comprehensive path filters to trigger workflows only when relevant files change:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
      - 'lib/**'
      - 'package*.json'
      - '.github/workflows/workflow-name.yml'
```

### 4. **Timeout Management**

Set strict timeouts for all jobs and steps to prevent runaway processes:

```yaml
jobs:
  job-name:
    timeout-minutes: 15  # Adjust based on job complexity
```

### 5. **Enhanced Caching Strategy**

Implement multi-layer caching with versioning:

```yaml
env:
  CACHE_VERSION: v3

steps:
  - name: Enhanced caching
    uses: actions/cache@v4
    with:
      path: |
        ~/.npm
        node_modules
        dist/
        .cache/
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ env.CACHE_VERSION }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
      restore-keys: |
        ${{ runner.os }}-${{ env.CACHE_VERSION }}-
```

## 🚀 Implementation Patterns

### Standard Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: Workflow Name - Performance Optimized

permissions:
  contents: read
  # Add other permissions as needed

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
    paths:
      - 'relevant/**'
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'relevant/**'
  workflow_dispatch:

# CRITICAL: Concurrency control
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

env:
  NODE_ENV: ci
  CI: true
  NPM_CONFIG_PROGRESS: false
  NPM_CONFIG_AUDIT: false
  NPM_CONFIG_FUND: false
  NPM_CONFIG_PREFER_OFFLINE: true
  CACHE_VERSION: v3
  FORCE_COLOR: 0

jobs:
  preflight:
    name: Pre-flight Analysis
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 3
    outputs:
      should-run: ${{ steps.changes.outputs.should-run }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2
      - name: Analyze changes
        id: changes
        run: |
          # Implementation-specific change detection

  main-job:
    name: Main Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: preflight
    if: needs.preflight.outputs.should-run == 'true'
    timeout-minutes: 15
    strategy:
      fail-fast: true
      max-parallel: 2
    steps:
      # Optimized implementation
```

## 📋 Workflow-Specific Guidelines

### Node.js CI Workflows

- Use Node.js LTS versions (18.x, 20.x) for essential testing
- Implement fail-fast strategies with `max-parallel: 2`
- Use offline-first npm operations
- Enable build caching with smart invalidation

### Test Workflows

- Set test timeouts based on complexity
- Use `maxWorkers` to control parallel execution
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Upload test artifacts with retention limits

### Deployment Workflows

- Use `cancel-in-progress: false` for production deployments
- Implement health checks before deployment
- Add rollback mechanisms
- Generate deployment reports

### Security Workflows

- Skip external PRs to avoid permission issues
- Implement graceful degradation for missing secrets
- Add timeout controls for security scans
- Use continue-on-error appropriately
